I had no idea how it would be and what I had to do, I just knew that: I wanted to walk tall, believe in myself, having the courage to ask what I wanted and needed, and live a life that mattered. I wanted to wake up in the morning with a smile on my face and know that I was loved that I belonged. I was desperate to feel worthy and I was hungry for the opportunity to live my fullest potential. Now after years I still want them and I am looking forward to catch them.`;
